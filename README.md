## Development Process

The development process follows [the standard Human Made development process](http://engineering.hmn.md/how-we-work/process/development/).

Here's a quick summary:

* Assign issues you're working on to yourself.
* Work on a branch per issue, something like `name-of-feature`. One branch per feature/bug, please.
* File a PR early so it can be used for tracking progress.
* When you're finished, mark the PR for review by labelling with "Review &amp; Merge".
* Get someone to review your code, and assign to them; if no one is around, the project lead () can review.
